Google Cloud Platform (GCP) organizes its resources in a **hierarchical structure** to help manage access control, billing, and policies efficiently.

---

## 🏗️ Hierarchy Overview :

The hierarchy has **four main levels** (from top to bottom):

Organization → Folder(s) → Project(s) → Resource(s)

---

## 🔝 1. Organization (Root Node)

- **Top-most node** in the hierarchy.
- Represents your entire company or domain, e.g. `example.com`.
- Policies (like IAM roles or organization policies) set here apply to **everything** below.
- Managed by **Organization Administrators**.

## 🗂️ 2. Folders

- Optional layer to **group projects** logically.
- Can be nested to reflect departments, teams, or environments (e.g., *Finance → Production → GCP Project*).
- Useful for delegating admin rights to departments or managing policy inheritance.

## 📦 3. Projects

- The **core unit** of resource organization and management in GCP.
- Every GCP resource (VM, storage bucket, etc.) must belong to a **single project**.
- Each project has:
  - **Project ID** (unique globally)
  - **Project Name**
  - **Project Number**
- Billing, APIs, and IAM roles are managed at the **project level**.

## ⚙️ 4. Resources

- These are the **actual GCP services** you create and use — like Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets, etc.
- They live **inside a project**.
- Access control is inherited from the project and above.


---

## 🔐 IAM Policy Inheritance

- IAM (Identity and Access Management) **policies cascade down** the hierarchy.
  - A role granted at the **Organization** level applies to all folders, projects, and resources beneath it.
  - Lower levels can override or add more specific roles.
